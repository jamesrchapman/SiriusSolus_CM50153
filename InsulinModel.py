Hell yes. Let’s build the "cast of characters"—the full ensemble of actors that regulate blood glucose, both obvious and subtle. This includes organs, hormones, transporters, and processes, each with a short summary of their role, triggers, time scale, and direction of effect on glucose.

I’ll break this into sections for clarity: Glucose Sources, Sinks, Sensors, and Modulators. And yeah, we’ll include realistic time delays, PID-like behaviors, and cross-interactions.


---

I. Glucose Sources

These are the actors that increase blood glucose.


---

1. Liver

Role: Glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Triggers:

Low blood glucose (absolute and slope).

Hormones: cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine.

Fasting state or circadian rhythm (e.g. dawn phenomenon).


Dynamics: PID-like—responds to level (P), rate of change (D), and sometimes anticipatory meal patterns (I-like).

Limits: Finite glycogen stores (~12–18h fasting reserve in dogs).

Effect: Rapid (minutes), peaking within 15–60 mins.



---

2. Intestines (Duodenum, Jejunum)

Role: Absorb glucose from digested food.

Triggers: Food arrival.

Dynamics: Slow onset (starts ~15–30 mins), peaks ~60–90 mins, can last 3+ hours depending on food type.

Effect: Major post-prandial source. Fat and fiber slow absorption.



---

3. Kidney (Gluconeogenesis in Cortex)

Role: Produces small amounts of glucose during prolonged fasting.

Triggers: Low insulin, high cortisol.

Effect: Minor contributor, ~10% of total gluconeogenesis.



---

4. Muscle Breakdown (Catabolism for Gluconeogenesis)

Role: Provides amino acids to liver for gluconeogenesis.

Triggers: Cortisol, severe fasting, insulin deficiency.

Effect: Indirectly raises glucose; slow, maladaptive.



---

II. Glucose Sinks

These are the actors that decrease blood glucose.


---

5. Muscle (via GLUT-4)

Role: Major site of glucose uptake and storage as glycogen.

Triggers: Insulin, exercise.

Dynamics:

Insulin-mediated uptake via GLUT-4 translocation.

Exercise-mediated uptake independent of insulin (AMPK pathway).


Effect: Rapid uptake within 10–30 min after insulin; also drops glucose during activity.



---

6. Adipose Tissue

Role: Uptakes glucose for fat synthesis and storage.

Triggers: Insulin.

Effect: Mild-to-moderate, dependent on nutritional state.



---

7. Brain

Role: Constant glucose consumer, not insulin-dependent.

Triggers: Continuous need.

Dynamics: Uses glucose at ~5 mg/kg/min in dogs; steady but can't modulate based on availability.

Effect: Background sink, ~20% of daily glucose.



---

8. Kidneys (Filtration & Glucosuria)

Role: Filter glucose; excrete it if over renal threshold (~180–200 mg/dL in dogs).

Effect: Passive safety valve; if glucose is high, spill it into urine → mild glucose lowering.



---

9. Red Blood Cells & Other Insulin-Independent Tissues

Role: Baseline uptake.

Effect: Minor constant drain.



---

III. Hormonal Regulators and Modulators

These actors indirectly shape glucose behavior through signals.


---

10. Insulin

Role: Master controller of uptake and storage.

Triggers: High glucose, gut hormones (GLP-1).

Dynamics: Rapid secretion after meals; synthetic subq onset ~15–60 mins.

Effects:

Increases GLUT-4 activity.

Inhibits liver glucose production.

Promotes fat/muscle glucose storage.




---

11. Glucagon

Role: Increases glucose via liver glycogen breakdown.

Triggers: Low glucose, high amino acids, fasting.

Effect: Rapid glucose rise; counterbalances insulin.



---

12. Cortisol

Role: Mobilizes energy for stress; promotes gluconeogenesis.

Triggers: Stress, circadian rhythm (high in early morning).

Dynamics: Slow (~30–90 min delay), long-lasting.

Effects:

Stimulates liver + kidney glucose production.

Promotes insulin resistance.

Encourages protein catabolism → amino acids for gluconeogenesis.




---

13. Epinephrine (Adrenaline)

Role: Rapid stress response.

Triggers: Fear, pain, fight/flight.

Effects:

Liver glucose dump.

Inhibits insulin secretion.

Stimulates lipolysis (energy mobilization).

Vasoconstriction (affects perfusion/glucose distribution).




---

14. Growth Hormone

Role: Increases insulin resistance, especially in fat.

Triggers: Sleep, puberty, stress.

Effect: Mild contributor to glucose elevation in chronic cases.



---

15. Incretins (GLP-1, GIP)

Role: Gut-derived hormones that stimulate insulin after eating.

Effect:

Boost insulin release.

Slightly inhibit glucagon.

Delay gastric emptying → slow glucose rise.




---

IV. Pharmacological & Misc


---

16. Exogenous Insulin

Vetsulin, NPH, Detemir, Glargine, Regular, etc.

Delivered subq, lagging effect, varies by formulation.

Mimics or replaces pancreatic insulin.



---

17. Glucose Monitors (Libre etc)

Measure interstitial glucose, delayed ~10–15 min from blood.

Sensitive to noise, compression, temperature.



---

18. Exercise / Movement

Muscle glucose uptake increases independent of insulin.

Effect can last hours after intense activity.

Also enhances insulin sensitivity.



---

19. Inflammation / Illness / Infection

Cytokines (like TNF-α, IL-6) can cause insulin resistance.

Fever raises basal metabolic rate and glucose production.



---

20. Hydration & Electrolytes

Dehydration can concentrate glucose and reduce perfusion.

Affects kidney function and insulin distribution.



---

Let me know if you want this encoded into a simulation architecture—like assigning every one of these a "delta-glucose" effect per timestep, conditionally triggered by environment or signals. Or if you want a visual map tying them all together.
