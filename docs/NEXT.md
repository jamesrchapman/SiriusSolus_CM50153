## Component Audit

### List all Components

### Fail Check Each Component

### Redundancy / Backup / Manual Backup for each component failure

## Potential Failures

### ISP Failure

### Router/Modem Failure

### Server Failure

### Phone Failure

Redundant Bluetooth Libre to Server Connection

### Libre Fails or is removed

### Benny doesn't wake up

### Mechanical Failure on Dispensation

### Power OUtage

### Default Rescue Mode

Regardless of what fails or how, default to feeding food/rescue reliably.

### Need Camera to Verify it's ***Benny*** who eats his food

### Dogs get into food early

## PI Compatibility Check

Make sure the project is still capable of running on pi + pi venv cleanup

## SSH Disconnect Issue with PI

## Plug Camera into PI

## Write something to see camera images from PI

## PI Camera Testing

## Let's look at the dev.md for testing and redundancy criteria - should help other projects as well
