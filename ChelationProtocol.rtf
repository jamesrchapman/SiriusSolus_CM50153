✅ Protocol: Small-Batch Citrate Chelation of Vetsulin
Purpose: Speed up Vetsulin absorption by chelating zinc, with optional dilution to improve dose flexibility and promote monomer formation.

⚗️ Step 1: Prepare Materials
You’ll need:

Vetsulin (refrigerated, gently mixed)

Sterile 0.9% saline (0.5–1 mL at a time)

Sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (or sterile 10 mM citrate solution)

pH strips (range 6.0–8.0)

1 mL insulin syringes (U-100 preferred for dilution)

Sterile vial or small sterile container (5–10 mL)

Alcohol wipes

Timer

Optional: 0.22 µm syringe filter

🧪 Step 2: Prepare Citrate Buffer
If using powder:

Dissolve 0.294 g sodium citrate in 100 mL sterile water to get a 10 mM solution

Adjust pH to 7.0–7.2 with sterile NaOH or HCl

Filter through 0.22 µm syringe filter into a sterile container

Label, refrigerate, use within 2 weeks

Or buy sterile 10 mM citrate vials

🧯 Step 3: Dilute Vetsulin (Optional but Recommended)
Draw 0.1 mL Vetsulin into sterile vial

Add 0.3 mL sterile saline (total 0.4 mL = U-10 dilution)

Invert gently to mix (don’t shake)

This gives you 10 units/mL insulin that’s easier to measure and acts faster.

🧪 Step 4: Chelate Zinc (At Time of Injection)
Draw 0.1 mL of diluted Vetsulin into insulin syringe

Add 0.01 mL (10 µL) of sterile citrate buffer (10% vol)

Gently invert the syringe

Let sit 15–30 minutes at room temperature

📊 Step 5: Check & Inspect
Place a small drop on a pH strip — aim for ~7.0

Visually check:

Slight cloudiness = OK

Clumps or stringy flakes = discard

💉 Step 6: Inject and Monitor
Inject 0.05–0.1 mL (0.5–1 unit actual insulin)

Monitor Benny’s BG every 15–30 minutes for 4 hours

Watch for early drop (~30–60 min), peak (~1.5 hr), and tail (~3–4 hr)

Note any local irritation
