Maybe experiment with my dad's pH Meter ... Maybe we can get away with distilled water... Probably not.



Prototype Protocol: Vetsulin Chelation with Citrate Buffer (v0.1)
Purpose:
 To test the effect of citrate chelation and dilution on Vetsulin pharmacokinetics, aiming to reduce zinc-bound hexamer formation and accelerate insulin onset.

Supplies Needed:
USP sterile saline or bacteriostatic saline (preservative-free preferred)


Trisodium citrate dihydrate (lab-grade)


Citric acid (lab-grade)


0.22 µm PES syringe filters (sterile, hydrophilic)


Sterile luer lock syringes (1 mL and insulin syringes)


Sterile glass vials (10 mL or smaller)


Accurate scale (ideally mg precision)


pH meter or pH strips (range ~6.5 to 7.5)


Pipette (5–50 µL preferred)



Step 1: Prepare 10 mM Citrate Buffer (pH ~7.2)
Weigh ~0.0294 g of trisodium citrate dihydrate.


Dissolve in ~8 mL sterile saline (USP-grade) in a sterile beaker or glass vial.


Separately, prepare 10 mM citric acid solution by dissolving ~0.021 g citric acid in ~10 mL sterile water or saline.


Titrate the citrate solution to pH 7.2 using small aliquots of the citric acid solution (use pipette).


Filter final buffer solution using a sterile 0.22 µm PES syringe filter into a sterile glass vial.


Label and refrigerate. Discard after 5–7 days or if cloudiness/precipitate develops.



Step 2: Insulin Preparation (Per Dose)
Draw desired dose of Vetsulin into an insulin syringe (e.g., 10 units = 0.25 mL).


Draw 5x volume of citrate buffer into same syringe (e.g., 1.25 mL).


Optionally allow air bubble to aid mixing; gently invert or roll syringe.


Flick out air bubble; inspect for flocculation or opalescence.


Inject subcutaneously as usual.



Notes:
All preparation should be done using alcohol-wiped tools and sterile technique


Do not reuse vials, syringes, or filter assemblies


Adjust dilution ratio or citrate concentration if desired in future trials


Discard any chelated Vetsulin not used within ~30 minutes (pending stability testing)



Next Steps:
Record glucose curves post-injection to observe change in onset


Visually track insulin clarity and stability


Consider future test of lower (5 mM) citrate buffer or alternate dilution ratios (e.g., 1:3)

Here’s your revised mini-protocol using serial dilutions and RO water:


---

10 mM Citrate Buffer (pH ~7.2) – Small-Scale Serial Dilution Protocol

Equipment needed
– U-100 insulin syringe (1 unit = 10 µL)
– RO water
– Stirring tool (pipette tip, sterile stick, etc.)
– Two small clean vials or tubes
– Scale accurate to ~1 mg
– Optional: pH paper or pH meter


---

Step 1: Make 1 M Citric Acid Stock

1. Weigh 210 mg citric acid


2. Add to 1 mL RO water


3. Label: “1 M Citric Acid”



(If already made, skip this)


---

Step 2: Dilute to 100 mM Citric Acid

1. Draw 10 units (100 µL) of 1 M stock


2. Inject into 900 µL RO water


3. Mix well


4. Label: “100 mM Citric Acid”




---

Step 3: Dilute to 10 mM Citric Acid

1. Draw 10 units (100 µL) of 100 mM


2. Inject into 900 µL RO water


3. Mix well


4. Label: “10 mM Citric Acid (for titration)”




---

Step 4: Make 1 M Trisodium Citrate Stock

1. Weigh 294 mg trisodium citrate dihydrate


2. Add to 1.5–2 mL RO water


3. Mix until dissolved


4. Label: “1 M Trisodium Citrate”




---

Step 5: Dilute to 100 mM Trisodium Citrate

1. Draw 10 units (100 µL) of 1 M stock


2. Inject into 900 µL RO water


3. Mix well


4. Label: “100 mM Trisodium Citrate”




---

Step 6: Dilute to 10 mM Trisodium Citrate

1. Draw 10 units (100 µL) of 100 mM


2. Inject into 900 µL RO water


3. Mix well


4. Label: “10 mM Trisodium Citrate”




---

Step 7: Titrate and Finish Buffer

1. Combine your 10 mM Trisodium Citrate with ~80% final volume RO water
– Example: 800 µL trisodium citrate + 100 µL water


2. Slowly add 10 mM Citric Acid, a few µL at a time


3. Stir gently and check pH


4. Stop when pH is ~7.2


5. Add water to bring final volume to 1 mL if needed

Let me know if you want a version scaled to more volume, or with sterile filtration steps.
