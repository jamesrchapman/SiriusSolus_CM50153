Well, we could make a many tube, door opens autofeeder so we just dispense based on needed dosing. Looks like a pipe organ basically, but they might funnel down into something that hits a bowl. (Maybe?) It would have to be high enough and sturdy enough that Benny can't hit it or if he did it wouldn't matter. . 
How do autofeeders work (basic principles)
It looks like they're pretty much just like some kind of container with a hole in the bottom with a door that opens.
It seems like it's not that complicated 
So what I could do is connect like basically any old Arduino and then use it as a server and controller for this guy. 
So I'd have the Arduino do the Libre link up pulling, I guess.. maybe it's LibreView. 
And a small amount of integration and then I guess open up a connection between my phone and that server… yeah. 
First thing is maybe just, alerts from something to integrate LibreView data and do a little calculation, probably just running from my phone all the time. 
Second thing would just be, “a food dispenser”
Third is a remote operated food dispenser 
Then we need a bell or smth with it
Then an integration of the Libre pull and the integration for automatic feeding mode
Then maybe add like an emergency syrup mode or just like cookie crumble dispense etc. 
Problems— verification so we might need like a camera which is kind of complicated. Dosing so like feeding the right amount or a specified amount
