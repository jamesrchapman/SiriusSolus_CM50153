get a pump
get a cannula/catheter
get some tubing

how am I gonna control it

how am I gonna read blood glucose levels

how are we going to get redundancies 

wear and tear/protection
batteries fail
tubing fucks up
insulin needs to be replaced

other issues: 
I mean just assume anything will break 
you really really don't want to overdose 
that's probably the biggest immediate issue because it's like fatal. 



Dog diabetes advice generally

Right now, it seems like the biggest problem is that a dog probably won't wear an insulin pump, like ever, without fucking it up majorly.
