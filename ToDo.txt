get a pump
get a cannula/catheter
get some tubing

how am I gonna control it

how am I gonna read blood glucose levels

how are we going to get redundancies 

wear and tear/protection
batteries fail
tubing fucks up
insulin needs to be replaced

other issues: 
I mean just assume anything will break 
you really really don't want to overdose 
that's probably the biggest immediate issue because it's like fatal.
